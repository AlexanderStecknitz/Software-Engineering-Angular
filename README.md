# Zimmermann Kunde

A webserver that can search, update and create "Kunden" aka Customers. Comes with authentication.
Written by Alexander Seitz, Alexander Stecknitz and Henrik Chung, original code by Jürgen Zimmermann.

## Installing dependencies

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Running the server

Run `npm start` to start the server. Development mode is active by default and will reboot on file-change.
A kunde-server with a running DB-server is necessary for the webserver to be fully functional. These can be procured from Jürgen Zimmermann.

## Running unit tests

WIP.
